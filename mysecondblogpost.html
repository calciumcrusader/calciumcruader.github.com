      <ul>
          <li>So friends this is a two in one day post.</li>
          <li> Just checking something out to see if it possible</li>
    <h3>This is a rough guideline for how the game will be like</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Major game mechanics</li>
        <li>interchangable parts</li>
        <li>each part comes with a deck of options</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>5 turns</li>
        <li>first turn is set-up. you will draw and set-up your hand</li>
        <li>second turn is radar/recon. your head part will affect this. Potentially through deck filtering or maybe head based attacks or the ability to mess with your opponents deck who knows</li>
        <li>thrid turn is manuevuer/movement your leg slot will affect this. Potentially you will be using this to gain something known as advantage or correct positioning such as a ranged attack or a melee attack</li>
        <li>fourth turn is attack. your arms/weapon slot will affect this. potentially dealing damage or setting your opponent at a disadvantage</li>
        <li>fifth and final turn is clean-up this is where you discard your hand or use and core abilitys that occur at end of turn</li>
