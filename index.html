        <ul>
          <li>So I will be using this website to blog the process on my new digital
        card game I intend to make.</li>
          <li>The setting of the game will be that both
        players (for right now just two player) are issuing commands to their
        respective pilots who are piloting giant robots.</li>
          <li>The games goal is to defeat the opponent using a variety of attacks depending on what weapons
        are being equipped.</li>
          <li>Now the point of the game which makes it a card game
        in the general sense is that you can collect different equipment (such
        as arms, legs, head piece, core, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <a href="http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/">Here is a website that also does a digital cardgame</a>
