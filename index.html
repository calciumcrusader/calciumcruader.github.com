      <p>So I will be using this website to blog the process on my new digital
        card game I intend to make. The setting of the game will be that both
        players (for right now just two player) are issuing commands to their
        respective pilots who are piloting giant robots. The games goal is to
        defeat the opponent using a variety of attacks depending on what weapons
        are being equipped. Now the point of the game which makes it a card game
        in the general sense is that you can collect different equipment (such
        as arms, legs, head piece, core, etc).
